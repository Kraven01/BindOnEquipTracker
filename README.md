# BindOnEquipTracker

BindOnEquipTracker is a World of Warcraft addon that provides a user interface for tracking Bind on Equip (BoE) items from various dungeons and raids. The addon categorizes items by expansion and instance, allowing players to easily browse through loot tables and view item details.

The idea is to combine this addon with other addons that provide tooltip information, like Auctioneer or TSM. With these, you can quickly browse through each instance and check whether it's worth doing a transmog farm for that instance. The main benefit of this addon is that you only see BoE items, allowing you to quickly decide the value of farming a particular instance.

Currently, only classic instances are supported, but the plan is to include data from other expansions.
